## List of Exercises
**1. Product Inventory Project** - Create an application which manages an inventory of products. Create a product class which has a price, id, and quantity on hand. Then create an *inventory* class which keeps track of various products and can sum up the inventory value.

**2. Company Manager** - Create an hierarchy of classes - abstract class Employee and subclasses HourlyEmployee, SalariedEmployee, Manager and Executive. Every one's pay is calculated differently, research a bit about it.
                         After you've established an employee hierarchy, create a Company class that allows you to manage the employees. You should be able to hire, fire and raise employees.
